# Dominion Randomizer
Web Based Dominion Randomizer. This is an aid for the card game Dominion. This project was a way for me to learn AngularJS, and practice with Bootstrap and other web technologies. It uses JSON for all the cards. I got the original JSON files here: https://github.com/cypressf/dominion/blob/master/cards.json, but that only contained cards through Dark Ages, and needed additional modifications.
The events and landmarks JSON I got from here: https://github.com/TruthNZ/DominionShuffle/
