# dominionranomizer
Web Based Dominion Randomizer. Uses JSON for all the cards. Not all cards have been added. I lost the source of the original JSON file, but that only contained cards through Dark Ages, and needed additional modifications.
This project also contains some extra code for my Star Trek Deck Building Game mod.
