# Dominion Randomizer
Web Based Dominion Randomizer. This is an aid for the card game Dominion. This project was a way for me to learn AngularJS, and practice with Bootstrap and other web technologies. Uses JSON for all the cards. Not all cards have been added yet. I got the original JSON files here: https://github.com/cypressf/dominion/blob/master/cards.json, but that only contained cards through Dark Ages, and needed additional modifications.
The events and landmarks JSON I got from here: https://github.com/TruthNZ/DominionShuffle/
This project also contains some extra code for my Star Trek Deck Building Game mod.
